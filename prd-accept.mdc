Rule: prd-accept

Trigger:
- When the user approves a piece of code and writes a command starting with "all good", this rule is triggered.

Action:
1. Open the prd.md file.
2. Find the "## Done" section in the file.
3. Search for the latest approved output (the one the user confirmed with "all good") in this section.
4. If this output is not in the "## Done" list, append it to the bottom.
5. If it already exists, do nothing.

Context:
- This rule only executes when the user starts their command with "all good".
- This rule ensures that newly developed features are updated in the @prd.md file.
